                    <blockquote>
                        I am a talented, ambitious and hardworking individual, with broad skills and experience in Information
                         Technology such as Computer Repairs and System Adminstration.<br>
                        Furthermore, I am adept at handling multiple tasks on a daily basis competently and at working well under pressure.
                        A key strength is communication; building strong relationships with people in order to deliver the best results.
                        Recently, I completed an NVQ-J certificate, including Web Development modules at the Amber Group/HEART Trust NTA.
